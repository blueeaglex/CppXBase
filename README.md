# CppXBase
The modern C++ offers the developers lots of possibilities to create great software. Meanwhileï¼Œit also offers us chances to make
mistakes, suffering from too many choice.
    Cpp Cross-platform Project is to improve the situation by building a common used lightweight cpp library. As c++17 has not been applied on every project or every machine, this library defined some necessary cross-platform interfaces for buiding a typical c++ application with minmum code to supply the gap of std c++ API.
